# Package Microservices
In the following lab we will take a microservices application and package
it into Docker containers using `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose`

You can use the Katacoda interactive learning environment, `https://katacoda.com/courses/ubuntu/playground`.


Go to the directory, `flask-microservice`

```
cd flask-microservice
```

## Launch application 
Use Docker Compose to build all of the images and start the microservices:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

You should see all of the services start up

Letâ€™s confirm the application is responding 
```
curl localhost
```


```
Hello Linode! This page has been viewed 1 time(s).
```

Now curl the endpoint a few times to increment the counter.
After the counter has increased run the following to reset the page hit counter.

```
curl localhost/resetcounter
```

```
Successfully deleted redis and postgres counters 
```

Look at service logs to confirm 
```
docker-compose logs flaskapp
```

You should see something like this 
```

In this lab you used Docker Compose to simplify building multiple services and linking them together.
