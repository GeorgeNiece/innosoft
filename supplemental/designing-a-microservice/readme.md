Microservice Architecture Definition Worksheet

The goal of the exercise is to design and describe your microservice to the level of detail that the work can be assigned to a third party contractor for implementation.

You design is “language and framework agnostic”. As such your team needs to address
the essentials of the microservices design that need to be understood and implemented
with little or no regard to implementation technology.

The following questions are intended to help bring clarity to your design efforts and detail to your specification.

1. What is the semantic definition of your microservice? In order words, what is the concern of the service. At a logical level,
what is it supposed to do?

2. Is your microservice intended to be synchronous, asynchronous, or both?

3. How will the microservice be exposed to consumers of the service?

4. What is the structure/format of the data the microservice will consume?

5. What is the structure/format of the data the microservice will emit?

6. How will the microservice be secured?

7. What are the operational boundaries of the microservice in terms of latency? 

8. What are the operational boundaries in terms of resource consumption? 

9. To what degree do you guarantee the accuracy of your data?

10. What is the scope of monitoring the service needs to support?
